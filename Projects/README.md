# Project: Data Modeling with Cassandra

## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring us on the project. Our role is to create a database for this analysis. We'll be able to test our database by running queries given to us by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.

## Project Overview
In this project, We'll apply what we've learned on data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete this project, we will need to model our data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries.
